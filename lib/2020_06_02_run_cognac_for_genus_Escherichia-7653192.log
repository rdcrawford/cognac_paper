Creating concatenated gene alignment:
  -- 11639 genomes were input
  -- Writing results to: ../analysis/2020_06_02_genus_cognac_aligments/Escherichia/
  -- Running on: 12 cores

Step 1: parsing the data on the input genomes
  -- Parsed the data for 61042774 coding genes
  -- Finished in 15.32 minutes

Step 2: finding orthologs with cd-hit
  -- The genes were classified into 431867 clusters of orthologous genes
  -- Continuing with 3203 genes present in at least 9794 occurrences
  -- Finished in 152.57 minutes

Step 3: filtering for single copy genes
  -- 162 multi-copy genes were identified
  -- After filtering there are 3041 remaining genes
  -- Finished in 0.47 minutes

Step 4: selecting genes to include in the alignment
  -- Removing 21 genomes missing all of the selected core genes
  -- 900 genomes are missing greater than 1% of genes
  -- There are 10739 genomes remaining
  -- 1353 genes met the criteria to be included in the alignment
  -- Finished in 1.2 minutes

Step 5: aligning and concatenating orthologous genes
  -- The total alignment length is 387857
  -- Finished in 312.23 minutes

Step 6: creating output files
  -- Finished in 0.34 minutes
  -- Reverse translate:
  -- Finished in 57.82 minutes
  -- Distance matrix:
  -- Finished in 120.51 minutes
  -- Finished in 48.25 minutes
