Creating concatenated gene alignment:
  -- 1947 genomes were input
  -- Writing results to: ../analysis/2020_06_02_genus_cognac_aligments/Enterobacter/
  -- Running on: 12 cores

Step 1: parsing the data on the input genomes
  -- Parsed the data for 9575752 coding genes
  -- Finished in 2.32 minutes

Step 2: finding orthologs with cd-hit
  -- The genes were classified into 232025 clusters of orthologous genes
  -- Continuing with 3129 genes present in at least 1638 occurrences
  -- Finished in 20.67 minutes

Step 3: filtering for single copy genes
  -- 107 multi-copy genes were identified
  -- After filtering there are 3022 remaining genes
  -- Finished in 0.06 minutes

Step 4: selecting genes to include in the alignment
  -- 121 genomes are missing greater than 1% of genes
  -- There are 1826 genomes remaining
  -- 1671 genes met the criteria to be included in the alignment
  -- Finished in 0.1 minutes

Step 5: aligning and concatenating orthologous genes
  -- 1 of genes without variation were removed
  -- 1670 were included in the alignment
  -- The total alignment length is 551522
  -- Finished in 71.62 minutes

Step 6: creating output files
  -- Finished in 0.04 minutes
  -- Reverse translate:
  -- Finished in 5.93 minutes
  -- Distance matrix:
  -- Finished in 7.31 minutes
  -- Finished in 0.09 minutes
