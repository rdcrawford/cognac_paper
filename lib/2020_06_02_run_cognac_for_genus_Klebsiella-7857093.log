Creating concatenated gene alignment:
  -- 9879 genomes were input
  -- Writing results to: ../analysis/2020_06_02_genus_cognac_aligments/Klebsiella/
  -- Running on: 12 cores

Step 1: parsing the data on the input genomes
  -- Parsed the data for 55944623 coding genes
  -- Finished in 13.49 minutes

Step 2: finding orthologs with cd-hit
  -- The genes were classified into 424291 clusters of orthologous genes
  -- Continuing with 4139 genes present in at least 8313 occurrences
  -- Finished in 138.45 minutes

Step 3: filtering for single copy genes
  -- 108 multi-copy genes were identified
  -- After filtering there are 4031 remaining genes
  -- Finished in 0.97 minutes

Step 4: selecting genes to include in the alignment
  -- 508 genomes are missing greater than 1% of genes
  -- There are 9371 genomes remaining
  -- 1957 genes met the criteria to be included in the alignment
  -- Finished in 0.79 minutes

Step 5: aligning and concatenating orthologous genes
  -- The total alignment length is 631196
  -- Finished in 594.4 minutes

Step 6: creating output files
  -- Finished in 0.42 minutes
  -- Reverse translate:
  -- Finished in 58.89 minutes
  -- Distance matrix:
  -- Finished in 156.79 minutes
  -- Finished in 30.24 minutes
