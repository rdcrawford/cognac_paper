Creating concatenated gene alignment:
  -- 520 genomes were input
  -- Writing results to: ../analysis/2020_06_02_genus_cognac_aligments/Serratia/
  -- Running on: 12 cores

Step 1: parsing the data on the input genomes
  -- Parsed the data for 2673835 coding genes
  -- Finished in 0.62 minutes

Step 2: finding orthologs with cd-hit
  -- The genes were classified into 94299 clusters of orthologous genes
  -- Continuing with 3658 genes present in at least 437 occurrences
  -- Finished in 4.36 minutes

Step 3: filtering for single copy genes
  -- 103 multi-copy genes were identified
  -- After filtering there are 3555 remaining genes
  -- Finished in 0.06 minutes

Step 4: selecting genes to include in the alignment
  -- 31 genomes are missing greater than 1% of genes
  -- There are 489 genomes remaining
  -- 1109 genes met the criteria to be included in the alignment
  -- Finished in 0.02 minutes

Step 5: aligning and concatenating orthologous genes
  -- 4 of genes without variation were removed
  -- 1105 were included in the alignment
  -- The total alignment length is 327628
  -- Finished in 8.13 minutes

Step 6: creating output files
  -- Finished in 0.02 minutes
  -- Reverse translate:
  -- Finished in 1.23 minutes
  -- Distance matrix:
  -- Finished in 0.27 minutes
  -- Finished in 0 minutes
