Creating concatenated gene alignment:
  -- 207 genomes were input
  -- Writing results to: ../analysis/2020_06_02_genus_cognac_aligments/Proteus/
  -- Running on: 12 cores

Step 1: parsing the data on the input genomes
  -- Parsed the data for 806518 coding genes
  -- Finished in 0.19 minutes

Step 2: finding orthologs with cd-hit
  -- The genes were classified into 43279 clusters of orthologous genes
  -- Continuing with 2733 genes present in at least 174 occurrences
  -- Finished in 1.23 minutes

Step 3: filtering for single copy genes
  -- 85 multi-copy genes were identified
  -- After filtering there are 2648 remaining genes
  -- Finished in 0.01 minutes

Step 4: selecting genes to include in the alignment
  -- 14 genomes are missing greater than 1% of genes
  -- There are 193 genomes remaining
  -- 1081 genes met the criteria to be included in the alignment
  -- Finished in 0.01 minutes

Step 5: aligning and concatenating orthologous genes
  -- 5 of genes without variation were removed
  -- 1076 were included in the alignment
  -- The total alignment length is 305078
  -- Finished in 3.26 minutes

Step 6: creating output files
  -- Finished in 0.01 minutes
  -- Reverse translate:
  -- Finished in 0.37 minutes
  -- Distance matrix:
  -- Finished in 0.05 minutes
  -- Finished in 0 minutes
