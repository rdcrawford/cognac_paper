This version of R is a base installation only, with no additional
libraries. The gcc/8.2.0 compiler is being automatically loaded. See
module help for more information. The gcc/8.2.0 compiler is required in
order to be able to load additional libraries for your use. If you unload
the gcc module, you will not be able to install new libraries for R.




Creating concatenated gene alignment:
  -- 262 genomes were input
  -- Writing results to: ../analysis/2020_06_02_genus_cognac_aligments/Citrobacter/
  -- Running on: 12 cores

Step 1: parsing the data on the input genomes
  -- Parsed the data for 1356975 coding genes
  -- Finished in 0.32 minutes

Step 2: finding orthologs with cd-hit
  -- The genes were classified into 73371 clusters of orthologous genes
  -- Continuing with 3079 genes present in at least 220 occurrences
  -- Finished in 2.15 minutes

Step 3: filtering for single copy genes
  -- 163 multi-copy genes were identified
  -- After filtering there are 2916 remaining genes
  -- Finished in 0.01 minutes

Step 4: selecting genes to include in the alignment
  -- 20 genomes are missing greater than 1% of genes
  -- There are 242 genomes remaining
  -- 1864 genes met the criteria to be included in the alignment
  -- Finished in 0.02 minutes

Step 5: aligning and concatenating orthologous genes
  -- 5 of genes without variation were removed
  -- 1859 were included in the alignment
  -- The total alignment length is 590749
  -- Finished in 11.61 minutes

Step 6: creating output files
  -- Finished in 0.01 minutes
  -- Reverse translate:
  -- Finished in 0.78 minutes
  -- Distance matrix:
  -- Finished in 0.18 minutes
  -- Finished in 0 minutes
