Creating concatenated gene alignment:
  -- 3051 genomes were input
  -- Writing results to: ../analysis/2020_06_02_genus_cognac_aligments/Pseudomonas/
  -- Running on: 12 cores

Step 1: parsing the data on the input genomes
  -- Parsed the data for 19509251 coding genes
  -- Finished in 4.72 minutes

Step 2: finding orthologs with cd-hit
  -- The genes were classified into 269449 clusters of orthologous genes
  -- Continuing with 5021 genes present in at least 2567 occurrences
  -- Finished in 42.73 minutes

Step 3: filtering for single copy genes
  -- 88 multi-copy genes were identified
  -- After filtering there are 4933 remaining genes
  -- Finished in 0.15 minutes

Step 4: selecting genes to include in the alignment
  -- Removing 1 genomes missing all of the selected core genes
  -- 406 genomes are missing greater than 1% of genes
  -- There are 2645 genomes remaining
  -- 1065 genes met the criteria to be included in the alignment
  -- Finished in 1.57 minutes

Step 5: aligning and concatenating orthologous genes
  -- The total alignment length is 313694
  -- Finished in 37.4 minutes

Step 6: creating output files
  -- Finished in 0.07 minutes
  -- Reverse translate:
  -- Finished in 7.73 minutes
  -- Distance matrix:
  -- Finished in 5.35 minutes
  -- Finished in 0.42 minutes
