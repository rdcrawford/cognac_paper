Creating concatenated gene alignment:
  -- 24 genomes were input
  -- Writing results to: ../analysis/2020_06_02_genus_cognac_aligments/Pluralibacter/
  -- Running on: 12 cores

Step 1: parsing the data on the input genomes
  -- Parsed the data for 131798 coding genes
  -- Finished in 0.03 minutes

Step 2: finding orthologs with cd-hit
  -- The genes were classified into 17138 clusters of orthologous genes
  -- Continuing with 3996 genes present in at least 20 occurrences
  -- Finished in 0.34 minutes

Step 3: filtering for single copy genes
  -- 161 multi-copy genes were identified
  -- After filtering there are 3835 remaining genes
  -- Finished in 0.01 minutes

Step 4: selecting genes to include in the alignment
  -- 1919 genes met the criteria to be included in the alignment
  -- Finished in 0 minutes

Step 5: aligning and concatenating orthologous genes
  -- The total alignment length is 611547
  -- Finished in 2.44 minutes

Step 6: creating output files
  -- Finished in 0 minutes
  -- Reverse translate:
  -- Finished in 0.09 minutes
  -- Distance matrix:
  -- Finished in 0 minutes
  -- Finished in 0 minutes
